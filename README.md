# t5_grammar_checker
T5 Grammar Checker model and workshop, trained using PyTorch FSDP

Goal - train a 800M / 3B / 11B T5 Model to serve as a grammar checker using PyTorch FSDP.  We'll cover both single node (one machine, multi-gpu) and multi-node (2+ machines, each with multi-gpus) training scenarios.  
Result - a trained model that can accept incoming sentences and correct a number of common grammar mistakes.

## Getting Started - the environment

For single node, we'll use an A100 (p4dn on AWS) or V100 (p3* on AWS).  
For multi-node, we'll use AWS ParallelCluster and Slurm.  

1 - Install this repo on your machine:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/lessw2020/t5_grammar_checker.git
~~~

2 - Install the dependencies (cd into the above install folder):
~~~
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~
You should receive something similar to:
~~~
Successfully installed datasets-2.2.2 dill-0.3.4 huggingface-hub-0.7.0 multiprocess-0.70.12.2 responses-0.18.0 tokenizers-0.12.1 transformers-4.19.3 xxhash-3.0.0
~~~~

3 - Uninstall any existing torch and torch libraries.  We will use the latest torch nightly build to ensure all FSDP features are available:
~~~
pip uninstall torch torchaudio torchvision
~~~

Assuming Linux:
~~~~
pip3 install --pre torch torchvision --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu113
~~~~
